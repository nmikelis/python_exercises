# Exercise 4: Remove first n characters from a string #
### Write a program to remove characters from a string starting from zero up to n and return a new string. ###

For example:

remove_chars("python", 4) so output must be tive. Here we need to remove first four characters from a string.
remove_chars("python", 2) so output must be native. Here we need to remove first two characters from a string.


**Note:** n must be less than the length of the string.
